The PIC-Lab is led by Dr. Qiuhua Huang, who is an Associate Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department at Colorado School of Mines. For more information of Dr. Huang, please visit his [homepage at Mines](https://electrical.mines.edu/project/huang-qiuhua/)

## Our Vision
Enable and accelerate electricity-centric energy system digitalization and decarbonization through **convergence** of physics, AI, computing and control.

## Research Areas

1. Power system modeling and simulation.
   * T&D system modeling and co-simulation
   * EMT-phasor co-simulation
   * Data-driven and physics-based hybrid/co-simulation
   * Advanced computing for power system simulation
2. AI for power and energy systems
   * Machine learning for power system operation and control
   * AI-enhanced cybersecurity for DERs and the Grid
   * Learning-based control for building and community
   * Physics-informed machine learning for power system modeling, simulation and control
   * Grid edge intelligence (together with edge computing, IOT)
3. Electrification
   * EV forecasting (Individual and system level)
   * Grid operation with high penetration of EVs
   * Building/community electrification and building to grid


## To Perspective Students
Our lab has strong connnections with the industry, national labs (PNNL, NREL, ANL, ORNL, BNL) and other universities in U.S. and across the globe. Students in our lab will have unique research, collaboration and industry internship experiences, as well as special life experience while living in the Denver metropolitan area which is known for outdoors, art, culture, food, music and sports. 

I strongly welcome students who have a master degrees in EE, CS, AI, IE/OR or relevant fields and are interested in the research areas/topics above to pursue their PhD degrees in our lab.  I also welcome outstanding undergradute students whose interests and research experiences are strongly aligned with the research areas above to join our lab as new PhD students. Please use [Perspective PhD student] in your email title. You are expected to be familar with our work through our publications and highlight how your previous research or project experiences are aligned with our research areas. **(Note: I usually hire 1-2 PhD students every year depending on the funding availability. I will read all emails and reply to students who I see would be a good fit and invite them for a video meeting)** 

For students who are interested in joining our lab as Master students with thesis, please note that I usually don't provide funding support to master students (priority is given to PhD students). 

For post-doc positions, I will make annoucements here if I have. I currently don't have any post-doc position.

For current students at Mines, if you like to do reserach in our lab or learn more about our work, please feel free to send me an email or stop by my office. 

## About me (and mentoring and research philosophy)

 I am a first-generation college student and pursuded my PhD degree in EE as an international student at Arizona State University from 2012 to 2016. With such a background, I fully understand and appreciate the challenges facing today's first-generation college students and international students: the uncertainty of career path, the financial burden, the expectation from your family while they don't fully understand your new life and PhD journey, and the difficulty in navigating new enviroment and learing new culture while doing well in your coures and research, the challenge of being far from home. I am incredibly fortunate to have had some incredible  mentors through my student life and later professional life, and that has inspired me to become a professor and instilled in me a lifelong commitment to mentoring. I support open, and equal mentorship. I want to create a safe, friendly and diverse environment for my students where they not just excel academically but also mentally. 

 I am passionate about sustainability and engineering for social goods. I believe in personal interest and motivation(passion) are the best teachers and can lead us through various challenges and to our final desitination or life goals. I respect students' interest and motivations. I will try my best to align them with the resesrch proejcts or topics in our lab (Note: there is no perfect alignment/match in the world). This is also why I want to make sure that every new member is truely interested in these topics before they join our lab. I don't like micro-management. However, as long as students need (or I see they need), I can and will provide suggestions and guidance as much or detailed as practically possible. This will definitely be dynamic during the course of students' PhD journey. Usually I tend to provide more direct and detailed suggestions/comments in the first year to help them get on track quickly and smoothly. 
 
 I also strongly believe in interdisciplinary research. The research in the lab lies at the intersection of power systems, renewable, building and transportation systems, AI, data science, computing, optimization, control, statistics, etc. As such, diversity is highly appreciated. Stduents' unique background and experience matters and will be appreciated in the lab. I want the students to be themselves as much as they can. Also, students are encouraged to read and expose to other research topic areas or domains. New ideas will usually emerge suddently after enough connections are made across domains.  Last but not least, I am a big fan and strong supporter of open source. This will maximize the impacts of our work in the long-term and promote reproducibility of all research work. Most of our previous research works have been open-sourced (we will add their links in our lab website soon), and we will continue to do so.
