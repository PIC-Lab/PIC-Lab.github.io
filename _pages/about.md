The PIC-Lab is led by Dr. Qiuhua Huang, who is an Associate Professor in the Electrical Engineering Department at Colorado School of Mines. For more information of Dr. Huang, please visit his [homepage at Mines](https://electrical.mines.edu/project/huang-qiuhua/)

## Our Vision
Enable and accelerate electricity-centric energy system digitalization and decarbonization through **convergence** of physics, AI, computing and control.

## Research Areas

1. Power system modeling and simulation.
   * T&D system modeling and co-simulation
   * EMT-phasor co-simulation
   * Data-driven and physics-based hybrid/co-simulation
   * Advanced computing for power system simulation
2. AI for power and energy systems
   * Machine learning for power system operation and control
   * AI-enhanced cybersecurity for DERs and the Grid
   * Learning-based control for building and community
   * Physics-informed machine learning for power system modeling, simulation and control
   * Grid edge intelligence (together with edge computing, IOT)
3. Electrification
   * EV forecasting (Individual and system level)
   * Grid operation with high penetration of EVs
   * Building/community electrification and building to grid

## Recent Openning (for Spring or Fall 2025)
We have an immediate open PhD position for students with strong background and/or interest in power system transient or dynamic transient stability simulation for power systems with high penetration of IBRs. Students with EE, Physics or scientfic computing backgorunds are  welcome. Good programming skill in  Python and/or C++/CUDA is desirable. Good knowledge and experience with at least one of the following simulation tools including PSCAD, EMTP, ATP, PSS/E, PSLF, PowerWorld, BPA, PSASP, DIgSILENT PowerFactory, PSAT, ANDES, InterPSS is required.  The student is expected to start in Spring or Fall 2025. This student will have many opportunities to directly work with national labs (e.g., NREL, PNNL, ANL), EPRI, industry members and researchers from other universities. We usually consider students with a master degree for PhD application with exception for excellent undergraduate students with research experience and publication already. 

The research experience at PIC Lab comes with added bonus to enjoy the wonders of Colorado and lots of outdoor activities for four seasons. 

Please contact Prof. Huang if you are interested in this opportunity and use email title " PhD Application - Power System Transient"
