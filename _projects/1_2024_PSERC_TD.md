**Summary**
As the implementation of FERC Order 2222 is coming and DER proliferate, it is imperative to (i) adequately model and efficiently analyze the dynamic impacts of DER on transmission and distribution (T&D) systems, (ii) capture and leverage full capabilities of DER to facilitate large-scale DER integration and T&D system operation. This project 1) Develops adaptive, multi-fidelity modeling and AI-accelerated co-simulation approaches to improve the computational efficiency of dynamic simulation for large-scale T&D systems; 2) Builds an automated tool to create a multi-fidelity model library for adequately representing distribution systems and DER while maintaining consistency for different dynamic and transient studies; 3) Derives aggregated reactive power capability curves at T&D interfaces by considering DER control capabilities and leverages them to provide reactive power ancillary services. The main outcomes will be open-source tools that help industry members efficiently plan and reliably operate their systems with high penetration of DER.
