Our lab has strong connnections with the industry, national labs (PNNL, NREL, ANL, ORNL, BNL) and other universities in U.S. and across the globe. Students in our lab will have unique research, collaboration and industry internship experiences, as well as special life experience while living in the Denver metropolitan area which is known for outdoors, art, culture, food, music and sports. 

I strongly welcome students who have a Master degree in EE, CS, AI, IE/OR or relevant fields and are interested in our lab's research areas to pursue their PhD degrees in our lab.  I also welcome outstanding undergraduate students whose interests and prior research experiences are strongly aligned with the research areas. Please use [Perspective PhD student] in your email title. You are expected to be familar with our work through our publications and highlight how your previous research or project experiences are aligned with our research areas. **(Note: I usually hire 1-2 PhD students every year depending on the funding availability. I will read all emails and reply to students who I see would be a good fit and invite them for a video meeting)** 

For students who are interested in joining our lab to pursue a Master degree with thesis, please note that I usually don't provide funding support to master students (as the priority is given to PhD students). 

For current students at Mines, if you like to do reserach in our lab or learn more about our work, please feel free to send me an email or stop by my office. 

For post-doc positions, I will make annoucements here if I have or am going to have.
