We recently kicked-off our Sloan Foundation-funded 3-year project focusing on retrofiting and electrifying a low-income community in Colorado. Our Lab will work on developing data-driven and physics-based control methods to manage and coordinate building energy usage at the community scale. We will collaborate with several faculty across Mines and external partners.
