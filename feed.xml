Students in our lab will have unique research, collaboration and industry internship experiences, as well as special life experience while living in the Denver metropolitan area which is known for outdoors, art, culture, food, music and sports.</p> <p>I strongly welcome students who have a Master degree in EE, CS, AI, IE/OR or relevant fields and are interested in our lab’s research areas to pursue their PhD degrees in our lab. I also welcome outstanding undergraduate students whose interests and prior research experiences are strongly aligned with the research areas. Please use [Perspective PhD student] in your email title. You are expected to be familar with our work through our publications and highlight how your previous research or project experiences are aligned with our research areas. <strong>(Note: I usually hire 1-2 PhD students every year depending on the funding availability. I will read all emails and reply to students who I see would be a good fit and invite them for a video meeting)</strong></p> <p>For students who are interested in joining our lab to pursue a Master degree with thesis, please note that I usually don’t provide funding support to master students (as the priority is given to PhD students).</p> <p>For current students at Mines, if you like to do reserach in our lab or learn more about our work, please feel free to send me an email or stop by my office.</p> <p>For post-doc positions, I will make annoucements here if I have or am going to have.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="lab"/><category term="student"/><category term="hiring"/><category term="lab"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Advices and notes for perspective students]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">About me and mentoring philosophy</title><link href="https://pic-lab.github.io/blog/2023/about-me-mentoring/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="About me and mentoring philosophy"/><published>2023-08-25T16:40:16+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-25T16:40:16+00:00</updated><id>https://pic-lab.github.io/blog/2023/about-me-mentoring</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pic-lab.github.io/blog/2023/about-me-mentoring/"><![CDATA[<p>I am a first-generation college student and pursued my PhD degree in EE as an international student at Arizona State University from 2012 to 2016. With such a background, I fully understand and appreciate the challenges facing today’s first-generation college students and international students: the uncertainty of career path, the financial burden, the expectation from your family while they don’t fully understand your new life and PhD journey, and the difficulty in navigating new enviroment and learing new culture while doing well in your courses and research, the challenge of being far from home. I am incredibly fortunate to have had some incredible mentors through my student life and later professional life, and that has inspired me to become a professor and instilled in me a strong commitment to mentoring. I support open, and equal mentorship. I want to create a safe, friendly and diverse environment for my students where they not only excel academically but also mentally.</p> <p>I am passionate about sustainability and engineering for social good. I believe that personal interest and motivation(passion) are the best teachers and can lead us through various challenges and to our final desitination or life goals. Therefore, I respect students’ interest and motivations. I will try my best to align them with the resesrch proejcts or topics in our lab. (It should also be noted that there is no perfect alignment/match in the world.) This is also why I want to make sure that every new member is truely interested in these topics before they join our lab. I don’t like micro-management. However, when students need help (or I see they do), I will provide suggestions and guidance. This will definitely be dynamic during the course of students’ PhD journey. Usually I tend to provide more direct and detailed suggestions/comments in the first year to help them get on track quickly and smoothly.</p> <p>I also strongly believe in interdisciplinary research. The research in the lab lies at the intersection of power systems, renewable, building and transportation systems, AI, data science, computing, control, etc. As such, diversity is highly appreciated. Stduents’ unique background and experience matters and will be appreciated in the lab. I want the students to be themselves as much as they can. Also, students are encouraged to read and expose to other research topic areas or domains. New ideas will usually emerge suddently after enough connections are made across domains. Last but not least, I am a big fan and strong supporter of open source. This will maximize the impacts of our work in the long-term and promote reproducibility of all research work. Most of our previous research works have been open-sourced (we will add their links in our lab website soon), and we will continue to do so.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="personal"/><category term="lab"/><category term="mentoring"/><category term="personal"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[About my life experience and mentoring philosophy]]></summary></entry></feed>
